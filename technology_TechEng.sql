During the rising process, the sewage mixes fully with the microbubbles generated by the aerator through the inflatable section. The aerator transfers the air above the water surface to the water through the air extraction pipe.The working principle of aerator is to use the high-speed rotation of the air impeller at the bottom of the air conveying tube to form a vacuum in the water. The air on the liquid surface is input into the water through the aerator to fill the vacuum. The microbubbles are then produced and spirally rise to the surface of the water, and the oxygen in the air is dissolved into the water.
Due to the density imbalance between the gas-water mixture and the liquid, a vertical upward buoyancy force is created, bringing the SS to the surface.During the floating process, microbubbles adhere to the SS. After reaching the water surface, the SS relies on these bubbles to support and maintain on the water surface. The SS floating on the water surface is removed intermittently by the chain mud scraper.The mud scraper moves along the entire liquid level and pushes the SS from the inlet end of the air float tank to the sludge discharge line at the outlet end.The sludge discharge pipe has horizontal propellers that feed the collected sludge into the mud collection tank.The purified sewage flows into the overflow tank and then flows to the biochemical treatment part.
An open return pipe extends from the aeration section along the bottom of the air float tank.At the same time of generating microbubbles, the concave aerator forms a negative pressure zone at the bottom of the pool with return pipe. This negative pressure makes the wastewater flow back from the bottom of the pool to the aeration zone and then back to the air floating section.This process ensures that about 40% of the sewage is returned and the air float section can still work without water.
The surface of oil wick and colloidal emulsifier has positive (negative) charge and double electric layer. The stability of emulsifying system is closely related to its electrokinetic potential (zeta potential).The emulsion layer is compressed by the double electric layer, the loss of stability, to promote the agglomeration of small colloidal particles into large particles separated from the water, this phenomenon is collectively known as demulsification or stability.However, the particles after stabilization are too small, and it takes quite a long time to separate from the water. Therefore, flocculant must be added to accelerate the separation with the help of adsorption, neutralization, bridging and flocculant trapping.
